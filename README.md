# Employee-Project-Data-Analysis-Python
Employee and Project Data Analysis using Python, Pandas, and DataFrame manipulation


## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing and transforming employee and project data** using Python and Pandas. The project involves creating dataframes, handling missing values, performing conditional updates, and generating a final consolidated dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To practice **Python programming and data manipulation** by performing step-by-step operations on multiple dataframes and extracting meaningful insights from employee and project data.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Employee.csv:** Contains employee details (name, age, designation, gender)  
- **Project.csv:** Contains project details (cost, status)  
- **OtherTable.csv:** Additional related data  

> All CSVs were created from Task 1 and used for subsequent tasks.

## 🔍 Tasks Performed
1. Created three separate DataFrames and saved them as CSV files.  
2. Replaced missing project costs with running averages using `for` loops.  
3. Split "name" into "First Name" and "Last Name" columns.  
4. Merged all three dataframes into a single `Final` dataframe.  
5. Added a 5% bonus for employees who completed projects.  
6. Demoted failed project employees and removed records with designation > 4.  
7. Added "Mr." / "Mrs." prefixes to first names and removed gender column.  
8. Promoted employees aged >29 by 1 designation level using IF condition.  
9. Calculated the total cost of all projects.
